Best Practices for MVPs

2. Determine basic functionality needed to test that assumption
  a. When you can avoid using software to build an MVP, do it. 
  b. the goal of the MVP is to validate assumptions so that when you build, you build your CORE functionality and outsource or delegate the rest. 
3. Examples of smart MVPS: 
  a. Conversations about how much potential customers would pay, followed by a credit card swipes
  b. FB ads
  c. landing pages and email sign ups
  d. Kickstarter or other crowdfunding platforms
4. Examples of poor MVPs: 
  a. expensive customized software
  b. any test that tests the wrong fundamental assumption
