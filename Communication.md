- Communication is paramount when working with coders, and it is a two way street that allows for a more satisfying product and experience for both parties 
  - It is easy for an individual engineer to withdraw and work on a project alone
- Its essential for engineers to be communicating their progress, thought process, hurdles, etc
- When hiring engineers you need to ensure they have good communication skills
- A good line of questions in interviews should focus on why they chose a certain framework, language, etc
  -The engineer's explanation of why they chose what allows you to see their thought process and oral communication skills
  - An explanation that is clear and logical to a non-technical person demonstrates a firm understanding of the subject matter
- Clear and open lines of communication ensure that both the client and developers are aware of the desired capabilities
  - A client can be very disappointed at the end of the process if they failed to mention a certain functionality (like the ability to create certain reports for instance) that they just assumed would be included
  - An experienced programmer can help foster conversation and keep open communication to avoid these disapointments by being open and progress and capabilities while managing expectations appropriately
- The engineer culture is distinct and quite different from the corporate culture of an organization
  - Althougth the engineering culture can be intimidating to some who isnt indoctrinated, it is crucial to keep open lines 
- Dont get intimidated by the thought of a really smart person coding away in a dark room, being friendly and open as people can only serve to help the process and product
