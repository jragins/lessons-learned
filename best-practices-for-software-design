Best Practices / Things to Consider for Software Development
1) Identify problem you are trying to solve, audience and how to reach them
  - Regarding engaging audience, evaluate whether website, mobile website or app is best way to engage them and maintain active participation
  - What will you build first?
  - what platform should you be using if mobile? coding language?
2) Define user stories and job stories to flesh out basic needs
3) Create MVP to get quick feedback
4) Make adjustments from MVP and further flesh out user/job stories
5) Aim to create code that:
  - writes code
  - is designed to be tested to avoid mistakes
  - is reusable
6) When hiring, make sure your developer is passionate/cares about craft - he/she will write code that provides solutions, not just quick hacks.
